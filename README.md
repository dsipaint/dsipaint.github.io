## Get Squigalin
This webapp was made for my girlfriend, who loves to colour in but only the big sections. This can be hard to find sometimes, so I made this webapp to generate images with only big sections so I can go and print them off for her to colour. There are a lot of things I want to change/improve about this app, but it's not my main focus at the moment.

Because of the limitations of github pages, the build is automated by CICD and built-out into the `docs/` directory

## TODO list

- Title animation is a little bit glitchy and lines can disappear incorrectly, this needs fixing
- Add new patterns to the page
- Add a "locking" system allowing a user to "lock in" patterns they like, then press the generate button again to reroll the other ones.
- Add an "I'm feeling lucky" button to get a completely random selection
- finetune the linespacings to ensure only big enough sections are generated
